1. Stable Release builds should have a round number with at most two digits as the last number place like:
    v0.4.11

2. Dev builds should start on the next number from the last Stable Release and count up by adding "d0", next would be "d1".
    Example (if the last Stable Release was "v0.4.11"):
    v0.4.12d0,
    v0.4.12d1,
    v0.4.12d2,
    ...
    v0.4.12d14,

3. When you ready ready to take a dev build and turn it into a stable release, just take the "d" part off.
    Example:
    "v0.4.12d14" becomes "v0.4.12" on release.

4. Don't forget to update the server's version to match the new release version!
